Write a program that performs multiple operations:

 

check for palindrome number
prints the pattern of stars in decreasing order based on the input
check whether the input number is a prime number
print Fibonacci series of size n with first two numbers as 0, 1
 

Using Switch case and do-While loop provide all the above functionality, such that user can select the functions that he/she needs to perform and exit the program based on the input.

 

Function Explanations in Brief: 

 
Palindrome number:
 
The numbers which give the same value when reversed are called palindrome numbers.
Example: 121, 12321, 512215, etc.,


Pattern of stars: 
 
Based on the input integer, the levels in the pattern and the number of stars in each level are decided. At every level, the number of stars is 1 less than the previous level.
